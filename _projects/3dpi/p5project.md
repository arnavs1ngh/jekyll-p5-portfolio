3D version of [this](https://arnavs1ngh.github.io/visuals/projects/MonteCarlo3D/p5project.html)
<br>
Could be interesting to think about the speed of convergence as you take this to higher and higher dimensions. I imagine that it would become a truly awful way to estimate pi but the comedic value is enough to justify doing this I guess.<br>
Are there other ways to use uniform distribution to generate interesting numbers like e or perhaps just a better way of finding pi? I dont know but would be cool to find out.

update: [Higher dimensional darts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_yU9eJ0NxA&t=1546s) could be something used to kill 2 birds with one stone, just need to find a way to approximate i for the complete trilogy now!
